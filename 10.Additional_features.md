# Ansible Tags:

Tags are aliases and very useful while running playbook, We can call tag name or we can skip a task by using tag name.

vim httpbytags.yml

```
---
- name: Setup Apache server
  hosts: localhost
  
  tasks:
  - name: Install httpd
    yum:
     name: httpd
     state: present
    tags: i-httpd
  
  - name: Start httpd
    service:
     name: httpd
     state: started
    tags: s-httpd
```

1.	To list all tags in a playbook: ansible-playbook httpbytags.yml --list-tags
2.	To skip a task using tag: ansible-playbook httpbytags.yml --skip-tags i-httpd
3.	To run a task using tag:  ansible-playbook httpbytags.yml -t i-httpd
4.	We can use “tasks option” to start a playbook at a specific task, but tags used in varies places.

ansible-playbook yamlfile.yml --start-at-task ‘Task name’

ansible-playbook http.yml --start-at-task ‘Install httpd’


# Ansible VARIABLES:

Variables are like containers that hold the defined value which can be used repetitively. 

IMPORTANT Things to Remember about variables:

1. Name can include letters, numbers, and underscore
2. Name should always start with a letter.
3. Cannot have a spaces, dots (.) or hypen (-) in variable name
4. Variables can be defined inside of inventory files as well.

Example of variable:

```
---
- name: Copy file to remote clients
  hosts: all
  vars:
   srcfile: /home/iafzal/somefile

  tasks:
  - name: Copying file
    become: true
    copy:
     src: “{{ srcfile }}”
     dest: /tmp
     owner: iafzal
     group: iafzal 
     mode: 0644
```

# VARIABLES IN INVENTORY:

We can see variables in inventory files also. 

Example:

```
[abc:vars]
fooserver=foo.abc.example.com
ntpserver=ntp.abc.example.com
proxyserver=proxy.abc.example.com
```

# Ansible Vault:

Ansible vault used to safe our yaml(Set the password), we can prevent yaml files editing from others and we can share securely from others.
 	
Steps:

1.	To create a vault file: ansible-vault create httpbyvault.yml
2.	To run vault file: ansible-playbook httpbyvault.yml --ask-vault-pass
3.	To edit vault file: ansible-vault edit httpbyvault.yml
4.	To get a list of options: ansible-vault --helP
5.	If we forget to vault the file,we can use encrypt command to set password: ansible-vault encrypt 1.yml

# ENCRYPT STRINGS:

We can encrypt a string and also put it in a yml file.

Command to encrypt a string: ansible-vault encrypt_string httpd

After we can use that string inside the playbook:

```
---
- name: Test encrypted output
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
   secret: !vault |
              $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
                         343430663635356335383138383833636161616331633266
              323761353632346532663662346534386664 636630313830303531
             666137666661303461535346135613566333439663230
             32653337386535323861323030643263323535326230
             3164

 tasks:
 - name: Print encrypted string
   debug:
    var: secret
```
Note: While we run the playbook, We can use the command: ansible-playbook httpbyvault.yml --ask-vault-pass
