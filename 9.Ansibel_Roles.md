# Ansible Roles:

Ansible Roles are used to smaller a playbook by splitting a playbook into multiple playbooks.

Sharing code among other teams are very difficult, while using roles we can achieve it easily.

We can create each task in a role file and then we call a role name in our playbook, So our playbook should not complex.

Steps to creating a role:

1.	Create a directory inside with your role name (/etc/ansible/roles/)
2.	Again create a directory inside your role folder name called tasks. Ex. mkdir -p httpfullinstall/tasks/
3.	Then create a main.yml file into the task directory and write your tasks.

We created two roles directory and put the below codes.


First role codes.

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# cat /etc/ansible/roles/httpfullinstall/tasks/main.yml
---
- name: Install httpd packages
  yum:
   name: httpd
   state: present

- name: Start httpd
  service:
   name: httpd
   state: started
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]#
```

Second role codes:

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# cat /etc/ansible/roles/httpbasicinstall/tasks/main.yml
---
- name: Install httpd packages
  yum:
   name: httpd
   state: present
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]#
```

Now only we are going to write a playbook to run these roles in multiple locations.

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# cat rolestest.yml
---
- name: Full install
  hosts: all
  roles:
   - httpfullinstall

- name: Basic install
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
   - httpbasicinstall
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]#
```

After I run this command, my remote system has httpd and in service in start stage and my localhost has httpd in installed state.


# Roles by application:

In the production environment, Usually we mange applications installations in each role file, while installing applications, We must call each application using role name.

Like Below.

Create yml files within these sub-directories

```
touch apache/tasks/main.yml
touch ntpd/tasks/main.yml
touch named/tasks/main.yml
```

# Roles in ansible Galaxy:

We can download roles from the following URL and we can use it in our infrastructure: http://www.galaxy.ansible.com/
