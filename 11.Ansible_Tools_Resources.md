# Other Automation Tools:

We can use chef and puppet also but those are all agent based but ansible in pure agentless. We can use ruby language to learn these tools but ansible is very simple.

Lack of documentation and very hard to implement.

Free ansible vs Redhat ansible:

If we are using ansible without redhat support, We can write our own code, we don’t get any support.

AWX is a open source GUI project but AWS tower is fully license based owned by redhat. 


# AWX and Tower:

AWX is a free tool and install ourselves. Tower is a fully paid.

we can raise bug through github while face any issue in AWX: https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues
