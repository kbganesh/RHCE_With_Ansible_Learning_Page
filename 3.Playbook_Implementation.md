# Hosts File Syntax:

One client listed in each file, and we can group clients also.

Location: /etc/ansible/hosts

Grouping example:

```
[appservers]
1.1.1.1
2.2.2.2
```

```
[DB servers]
3.3.3.3
4.4.4.4
```

IP Range, We can specify as follows:

1.1.1.[1:6]

We can save the ansible inventory file in different location also and need to intimate to playbook using the following command:  ansible-playbook -i (path)

We can use Aliases to remember the hostname. ( mentioned below)

```
[servers]
server1 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.110
server2 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.111
server3 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.112
server4 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.113
server5 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.114
server6 ansible_ssh_host=10.91.50.115
```

```
[appserver]
server1
server2
```

```
[webserver]
server3
server
```

Listing host file: ansible-inventory --list
