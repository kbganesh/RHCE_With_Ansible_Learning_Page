# Pick and Choose Steps:

We can Choose a task from playbook and run by using task name.

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# cat start.yml
---
- name: httpd and telnet
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Install httpd
    yum:
     name: httpd
     state: present

  - name: Start httpd
    service:
     name: httpd
     state: started

  - name: Install telnet
    yum:
     name: telnet
     state: present
```

Above is the script and we can use --start-at-task parameter, to start the script from start the http service onwards.

Command: ansible-playbook start.yml --start-at-task 'Start httpd'


# ANSIBLE AD-HOC COMMAND PART-1:

1. Ad-hoc is nothing but same as playbook but only using for not repetitive tasks. 
2. We use playbook for frequent task.

Syntax for Ad-Hoc ansible command:

ansible [target] –m [module] –a “[module options]”

3. Examples of Ad-hoc commands:

To ping a local machine: ansible localhost -m ping

To create a file in client machine : ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/adhochello.txt state=touch mode=700"

Output from Client:

```
[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]# ll
total 8
-rwx------. 1 root   root    0 Dec 26 10:50 adhochello.txt
```

4. To delete a file from Client node: ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/adhochello.txt state=absent"

5. To Copy a file from Control Node to Client Node: ansible all -m copy -a "src=/tmp/cpyadhoc.txt dest=/tmp/"



# ANSIBLE AD-HOC COMMAND PART2:


1. To install a package in client node: 1) ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd-manual state=present" 2) ansible all -m yum -a "name=telnet state=present"

Output from Client:

```
[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]# rpm -qa|grep httpd-manu
httpd-manual-2.4.6-99.el7.centos.1.noarch
[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]# rpm -qa|grep tel
telnet-0.17-66.el7.x86_64
[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]#
```

2. To start a service in Client node: ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
3. To enable a service to start during boot time: ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started enabled=yes"
4. We can see the service status of the client node by using the command: ansible all -m shell -a "systemctl status httpd"
5. We can Remove the service also: ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" (OR)  ansible all -m shell -a "yum remove httpd"

# ANSIBLE AD-HOC COMMAND PART3:

1. To create a user in client node: ansible all -m user -a "name=bala home=/home/bala shell=/bin/bash state=present"
2. To change the Group of user: ansible all -m user -a "name=bala group=centos"
 		
Output Before Exe:
```
	[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]# id bala
 	uid=1001(bala) gid=1001(bala) groups=1001(bala)

```
Output After Exe:
```
	[root@ip-172-31-46-7 tmp]# id bala
    uid=1001(bala) gid=1000(centos) groups=1000(centos)
```

3. To delete a user from Client node: ansible all -m user -a "name=bala home=/home/bala shell=/bin/bash state=absent"  (OR) ansible all -m shell -a "userdel jsmith"

4. To fetch informations of the client node: ansible all -m setup

5. We can reboot client node also by using the command : ansible 172.31.46.7 -a "/sbin/reboot"


# HANDLERS In ansible:

Basically, handlers are used to restart, stop or stop services at end of the play.

So basically, handlers are tasks that only run when notified.

Example1 :

```
---
- name: Verify apache installation
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum:
     name: httpd
     state: latest

  - name: Copy updated apache config file
    copy:
     src: /tmp/httpd.conf
     dest: /etc/httpd.conf
   notify:
   - Restart apache

  - name: Ensure apache is running
    service:
     name: httpd
     state: started

  handlers:
   - name: Restart apache
     service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

Example2:

```
---
- name: Enable service on firewalld
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
  - name: Open port for http
    firewalld:
     service: http
     permanent: true
     state: enabled
   notify:
   - Reload firewalld

  - name: Ensure firewalld is running
    service:
     name: firewalld
     state: started

  handlers:
   - name: Reload firewalld
     service:
      name: firewalld
      state: reloaded
```

Note: Don’t have any practical examples.



# CONDITIONS in Ansible:

Conditions are very powerful, and we can use in varies places. For example, we are going to deploy http for group of servers. In that group both ubuntu and centos servers are there. So, we can install apache2 for ubuntu and httpd for Centos by using when condition. Awesome.


Example:

```
---
- name: Install Httpd
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache on Ubuntu Server
    apt:
     name: apache2
     state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == "Ubuntu"

  - name: Install HttPD for Centos
    yum:
     name: httpd
     state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

Note: In the above variable, we used that ansible_os_family which is ver important , We can get the information by running the following command: ansible localhost –m setup.

We can get plenty of informations while running setup commands.


# LOOPING in ANSible:

Loops are using to run a particular task repeatedly. Use Cases: Changing permissions on hundreds of files, creating multiple users at once, Installing many packages on hundreds of servers.

Loops can work hand in hand with conditions as we loop certain task until that condition is met.

The first example below is for creating multiple users through loop, We can achieve it through two methods, One is by adding variable and another is by adding loop parameters.

The second method is installing multiple packages by using loop. Which is also we can call variable and directly use variable inside the loop.



Example1 Adding variable.


```
---
- name: Adding Variable
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
   users: [jerry,kramer,eliane]

  tasks:
  - name: Create users
    user:
     name: '{{ item }}'
    with_items: '{{ users }}'

```


Output:

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# ls -la /home
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  6 root   root    61 Dec 29 14:41 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 18 root   root   236 Aug 25  2022 ..
drwx------.  3 centos centos 111 Dec 21 12:04 centos
drwx------.  2 eliane eliane  62 Dec 29 14:41 eliane
drwx------.  2 jerry  jerry   62 Dec 29 14:41 jerry
drwx------.  2 kramer kramer  62 Dec 29 14:41 kramer
```

Example1 Adding Loop parameters:


```
---
- name: Create users thru loop
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
  - name: Create users
    user:
     name: "{{ item }}"
    loop:
     - jerry
     - kramer
     - eliane
```

Output;

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# ls -la /home
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  6 root   root    61 Dec 29 14:45 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 18 root   root   236 Aug 25  2022 ..
drwx------.  3 centos centos 111 Dec 21 12:04 centos
drwx------.  2 eliane eliane  62 Dec 29 14:45 eliane
drwx------.  2 jerry  jerry   62 Dec 29 14:45 jerry
drwx------.  2 kramer kramer  62 Dec 29 14:45 kramer
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]#
```


Example2 package install through by adding variable:

```
---
- name: Install packages thru loop
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
   packages: [ftp,telnet,htop]

  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    yum:
     name: "{{ item }}"
     state: present
    with_items: "{{ packages }}"
```

Output:


```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep telnet
telnet-0.17-66.el7.x86_64
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep ftp
ftp-0.17-67.el7.x86_64
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep htop
htop-2.2.0-3.el7.x86_64
```

Exmaple2 package install through by directly calling variable:


```
---
- name: Install packages thru loop
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
   packages: [ftp,telnet,htop]

  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    yum:
     name: '{{packages}}'
     state: present
```


Output:

```
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep telnet
telnet-0.17-66.el7.x86_64
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep ftp
ftp-0.17-67.el7.x86_64
[root@ip-172-31-35-78 playbooks]# rpm -qa|grep htop
htop-2.2.0-3.el7.x86_64
```
