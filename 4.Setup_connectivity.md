# Setup a connection from Ansible server to clients to perform Taks:

Make entry in inventory file.

```
[labclients] 
10.253.1.18
10.253.1.20
```
Generate Password by using the below commands and copy the password into client machines:


ssh-keygen

ssh-copy-id 10.253.1.18

ssh-copy-id 10.253.1.20


Now SSH into the clients to test:

ssh 10.253.1.18


Run Ansible add-hoc to ping remote nodes (make sure hosts file has remote clients IPs):

```
ansible all -m ping
ansible -a "uptime" all
```

# Enable Passwordless connectivity in AWS:

1. If you are using AWS for learning , You need to run the ssh-keygen command from root user in Control Node while you run the command ssh-keygen will create id_rsa.pub and id_ra files.(Double check)
2.  After login the Client node and go inside vi /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and paste the content of the Control node's id_rsa.pub and try to ssh from control node, You can ssh the client node without password by using root user.
3. Then Setup is ready good to go. (Steps tried amazon AWS CentoS image)


# Check remote client’s connectivity state:

```
---
- name: “Check remote client’s connectivity status”
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Test connectivity
    ping:
```
